                <p class="intro-mid">As so many families in the UK prepare to welcome Ukrainian refugees,
                    food from Eastern Europe acquires a new significance. It becomes not only a means of sustenance but
                    also a
                    language through which to let people, fleeing the horrors of war, know that they're welcomed and
                    that they have a new home.
                    It's a way to show that we care and that their stories matter.When someone loses their home and
                    their land, food becomes a lifeline.
                    We all know the power of food to comfort us during the dark times, to make us feel connected and
                    like we belong to a community.
                    I hope these recipes will help create a sense of home away from home, to offer comfort and a sense
                    of togetherness.</p>

                <p class="int-borsch">The first dish on the menu would have to be Bortsch,
                    the quintessential dish of Ukrainian cuisine and a real food for the soul.
                    <br>It varies, seasonally and regionally, but this classic version by Olia Hercules
                    will appeal to everyone.

                <p class="int-cabbage">Cabbage is a key ingredient in Ukrainian recipes and while
                    many may see this as proof of the age-old stereotype of bland and boring Eastern
                    European cuisine, there are, in fact, many vibrant dishes that this humble
                    vegetable lends itself to. <br>Try substituting the mayo for good quality unrefined
                    sunflower oil in this recipe, then add some dill and a sprinkling of toasted
                    sunflower seeds.</p>

                    particularly in Eastern Europe. <br>Known as pierogi in Poland, they're called
                    varenyky in Ukraine. <br>They can be filled with savoury and sweet stuffings,
                    which range from mashed potatoes and sauerkraut, to sweet curd cheese and
                    fresh berries. <br>Enjoy with a big dollop of soured cream.</p>

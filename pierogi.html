                    </ol>
                    <p>How to prepare a recipe:</p>
                    <p>Step 1:
                        First, make the crispy shallots.
                        Heat the oil in a saucepan to 180C (a cube of
                        bread will turn golden in 15 secs). Toss the shallots
                        in a little flour and deep-fry for 1 min or until light
                        golden and crispy. Drain on kitchen paper. Can be made
                        up to two days before and kept in an airtight container.</p>
                    <p>Step 2:
                        To make the filling, heat the oil in a medium
                        non-stick frying pan and gently fry the shallots for
                        10 mins until starting to turn golden.</p>
                    <p>Step 3:
                        Add the sauerkraut and cabbage,
                        and cook for 5-10 mins until the cabbage
                        has softened. Taste and add a little salt if
                        under-seasoned, or sugar if stringent. Scrape
                        into a bowl and leave to cool completely.</p>
                    <p>Step 4:
                        To make the dough, mix the eggs
                        and oil with 125ml water, then gradually
                        add in the flour, mixing well with your hands.
                        Knead it on a well-floured surface until the dough stops sticking to your hands. You should end
                        up with firm, elastic dough. Wrap it in cling film
                        and rest in the fridge for at least 30 mins, or
                        overnight.</p>
                    <p>Step 5:
                        Flour your work surface generously.
                        Roll out the dough to a 40cm circle or until the dough is as thick as £1 coin.</p>
                    <p>Step 6:
                        Using a 9cm cookie cutter,
                        cut out discs in the dough – you
                        should end up with about 25 discs. Do not throw
                        away the off-cuts – we throw them in with the pierogi when boiling to minimise any waste.</p>
                    <p>Step 7:
                        Have a well-floured tray ready. Put 1 tsp
                        of the filling into the centre of each disc.
                        In your hand, fold in half around the filling and seal
                        to create half-moon shapes. Put them on the floured
                        tray, making sure they don’t touch each other.</p>
                    <p>Step 8:
                        Bring a large saucepan
                        of salted water to the boil and carefully lower
                        the pierogi in. Boil them for 2 mins or until they
                        float to the top.</p>
                    <p>Step 9:
                        Drain and serve with a knob
                        of butter and some soured cream. Finish
                        by sprinkling the crispy shallots on top to serve.</p>
